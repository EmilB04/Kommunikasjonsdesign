            <h2>The calm before the storm</h2>
            <p>
                On the morning of the 26th of December, 2004, the beaches of Aceh Indonesia, looked peaceful and beautiful as usual. 
                Fishermen prepared their boats and fishing nets, same as countless times before, tourists strolled the calm beach, 
                and children splashed in the shallow water. The rising sun painted the ocean a soft gold, giving no indication of the catastrophe about to come. 
                Yet there were signs. The sea drew back farther than usual, exposing shells, fish, 
                and starfish according to witnesses. Birds rose in flocks, flying inland for safety, foreseeing the danger before any humans did. 
                Some locals felt tremors under their feet, a small movement that rattled windows and caused roofs to creek. 
                Still, for most people, it was a morning like any other. Few understood that nature was giving a crucial warning.<sup>[1]</sup>
            </p>
            <p>
                At 07:58 local time, a powerful earthquake struck beneath the Indian Ocean off Sumatra’s west coast. 
                Later named the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake, it registered between 9.2 and 9.3 in magnitude, placing it among 
                the strongest recorded in history. The seabed shifted up by several meters, pushing huge amounts of water out of place. 
                That sudden imbalance set the ocean into motion, producing big waves that were heading straight for the coastline.<sup>[1]</sup>
            </p>

            <h2>The arrival of the wave</h2>
            <p>
                First came silence. The water retreated, leaving beaches strangely bare. Many curious bystanders walked out onto the sand, 
                taking photos or collecting shells. Then came the wave of an unimaginable size. Survivors later compared it to the sound of a 
                jet engine or a wall collapsing. A dark line appeared on the horizon, growing taller and closer. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In Aceh, the first wave struck less than 20 minutes after the earthquake. It smashed into homes and streets, sweeping away cars, 
                boats, and people. Entire neighborhoods disappeared under the water, completly destroid. One survivor described it as a “black giant,” 
                a moving wall carrying trees, rubble, and bodies. Those who tried to run found their paths blocked by 
                collapsing buildings or flooded roads. Some clung to trees or rooftops, others were pulled into the unstopable force of whater.
            </p>
            <p>
                Further west, in Sri Lanka, the waves arrived about two hours later. The destruction was catastrophic. 
                A passenger train near Peraliya, later known as the “tsunami train,” was lifted off the tracks and overturned 
                by the surge, killing between 1,000 and 1,700 people.<sup>[2]</sup>.
                In Thailand, popular tourist destinations such as Phuket and Khao Lak were struck. Hotels that had been 
                flurishing with turists collapsed within minutes, leaving survivors to cling to wreckage in the water to stay afloat.<sup>[1]</sup>

            <h2>Voices from the disaster</h2>
            <p>
                Eyewitness accounts give a human face to the scale and impact of the tsunami. 
                In Banda Aceh, a man recalled: <br>
                “Hundreds of people were rushing by the street in front of our house, yelling Air naik! Air naik! 
                Allahuakbar! Allahuakbar! ("The water is rising, the water is rising! God is Great! God is Great!").”<sup>[3]</sup>
            </p>
            <p>
                Another survivor from Aceh told The Guardian: <br>
                “We saw bodies in the water. My house had been swept away. I had lost my wife and my son and I didn’t know what to do.”<sup>[4]</sup>
            </p>
            <p>
                For many, survival was a matter of luck and strength. Some clung to sofas or trees, riding the waves 
                inland before being able to get to higher ground. Others endured hours adrift before being rescued.<sup>[5]</sup>
            </p>

            <h2>The aftermath</h2>
            <p>
                When the ocean finally went back to its normal state, the scale of the devastation was almost beyond comprehension. In Aceh alone, more than 
                170,000 people were killed. Across the 14 countries that were impacted, total deaths reached between 227,000 and 230,000, making it one of 
                the deadliest natural disasters in modern history. Entire villages just disappeared. Families were torn apart, often with only a single member surviving.<sup>[1]</sup>
            </p>
            <p>
                In Sri Lanka, over 500,000 people were displaced, while in India thousands were killed along the Tamil Nadu coast. 
                Thailand lost thousands of residents and tourists, many of whom were swept out to sea before rescuers could respond. 
                In the Maldives, the normally breathtaking scenery was destroyed, leaving many islands temporarily uninhabitable.<sup>[6]</sup>
            </p>
            <p>
                The destruction went far beyond just human life. Infrastructure across the large region was left in ruins. Roads and bridges were 
                destroyed, power and water systems collapsed, and farm land was poisoned by saltwater. In fishing communities, 
                boats and nets were reduced to splinters, eliminating thousands of jobs overnight. The United Nations later 
                reported that more than 100,000 small and medium-sized businesses were wiped out completely.<sup>[7]</sup>
            </p>
            <p>
                In between the wreckage, survivors faced a new crisis: lack of clean water, food, and medical supplies, soon became apparent. 
                Relief camps sprang up, but resources were stretched thin accros such a large area. Disease outbreaks were a constant threat. 
                For weeks, mourning filled the air as mass graves were dug and families searched desperately for their missing loved ones.<sup>[5]</sup>
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>A global response</h2>
            <p>
                The scale of the disaster sparked one of the largest humanitarian responses in history. Aid poured in from around the world, 
                governments pledged billions in relief, while individuals donated generously. 
                Military forces from the United States, India, Australia, and other countries provided ships, helicopters, 
                and personnel to deliver food and to help rescue survivors.<sup>[1]</sup>
            </p>
            <p>
                The tragedy also led to major improvements in disaster preparedness. In 2006, the Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning and 
                Mitigation System was established, linking seismic monitoring with coastal sirens and community education. 
                Local governments began training their residents in evacuation drills, teaching them to see the signs like the 
                receding water or unusual animal behavior. The disaster clearly showed 
                that minutes of warning could mean the difference between life and catastrophic loss.<sup>[8]</sup>

            <h2>Lessons learned</h2>
            <p>
                To this day, the Indian Ocean tsunami remains a dark reminder of humanity’s vulnerability to the forces of nature. 
                Yet it also displayed the resilience of the human spirit. Survivors rebuilt their lives while dealing with grief and loss. 
                Communities learned to listen more closely to nature’s warnings. Scientists and politicians worked hard to ensure that 
                the world would be better prepared should a next time come.
