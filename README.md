## About

This project is part of the H2025 curriculum and focuses on communication design principles through practical application. Each story demonstrates different approaches to digital storytelling, from traditional journalism to conceptual analysis and historical documentation. The project showcases various design philosophies, technical implementations, and content strategies while maintaining high standards for accessibility, semantic markup, and responsive design.

**Design Approaches Explored:**

- Traditional storytelling (Story 1)
- Conceptual analysis (Story 2)
- Fact-based journalism (Story 3)
- Historical documentation (Story 4)
- Combination of storytelling techniques (Story 5)

## Stories Overview

### Story 1 - Julian Assanges historie

> Concepts — One win, two roads

A conceptual analysis examining the dual nature of sporting victories, using PSG's 2025 Champions League win as a case study. The article explores how celebration and violence can emerge from the same event, analyzing the social and economic impacts of major sporting achievements.

### Story 3 - Krigen i Ukraina

### Story 5 - AI in Our Daily Lives

> An immersive exploration of AI's impact on everyday life

A comprehensive longform article examining how artificial intelligence has become deeply integrated into our daily routines. The story explores AI's presence in morning routines, the invisible helpers we depend on, the costs of convenience (energy consumption, deepfakes, abuse), and the broader implications for work, school, and society. Features smooth scroll animations, parallax effects, and a modern dark-themed Apple-inspired design.
