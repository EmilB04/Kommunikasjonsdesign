## About

This project is part of the H2025 curriculum and focuses on communication design principles through practical application. Each story demonstrates different approaches to digital storytelling, from traditional journalism to conceptual analysis and historical documentation. The project showcases various design philosophies, technical implementations, and content strategies while maintaining high standards for accessibility, semantic markup, and responsive design.

**Design Approaches Explored:**

- Traditional storytelling (Story 1)
- Conceptual analysis (Story 2)
- Fact-based journalism (Story 3)
- Historical documentation (Story 4)
- Combination of storytelling techniques (Story 5)
