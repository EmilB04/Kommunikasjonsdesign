                <h3>Morning Routine</h3>
                <p>
                    Your alarm goes off. You're still groggy, but you tap it off anyway. Within seconds your phone's
                    doing things. Weather pops up.
                    Fresh Spotify playlist queued. Your usual commute gets rerouted because of some roadwork you didn't
                    know about.
                    You haven't even checked email yet. But somehow the important ones are already sitting at the top,
                    filtered.
                    You literally haven't said anything. But AI? It's been working for hours, quietly setting up your
                    morning.
                </p>
                <h3>The invisible assistant</h3>
                <p>
                    AI used to sound futuristic. Now? It's just... there. Familiar. Almost boring, honestly.
                    Every week there's some new breakthrough we scroll past, and most of us use these tools daily
                    without really thinking about it.
                    But here's what we don't usually think about, how much of our day runs on algorithms making
                    predictions.
                    Stories showing up in your feed? Algorithm. Your teacher's grading software? Algorithm. How doctors
                    get those diagnostic suggestions? Yep.
                    Even the songs Spotify throws at you while you're making dinner. All of it's happening behind the
                    scenes.
                </p>
                <h3>Feeding the algorithm</h3>
                <p>
                    There's something bigger happening beneath all this convenience. A system that's constantly watching
                    and learning from us,
                    building itself up with every bit of information we hand over. And we hand over a lot.
                    Every song you skip. Every route you take. Every random thing you Google at 2am when you can't
                    sleep.
                    AI isn't just following orders, it's watching. Learning. Over time, it figures out your patterns,
                    your preferences,
                    maybe even your moods before you do.

                    That's really what this whole story is about. The relationship we've developed with artificial
                    intelligence.
                    How it's woven itself into basically everything we do. How it shapes our decisions and thoughts in
                    ways we barely notice anymore.

                <h3>Autopilot mode activated</h3>
                <p>
                    Most of the time we have no clue how many decisions are being made for us. We just follow that blue
                    line on Google Maps.
                    Trust autocorrect. Scroll through Netflix recommendations without questioning where they came from.
                    It feels natural. Effortless, even. Part of modern life, right? But we rarely pause to think about
                    what's actually powering all that ease.
                    Systems running 24/7 in the background, constantly learning from what we click, where we go, what we
                    do.
                </p>
                <h3>From revolutionary to routine</h3>
                <p>
                    AI has become this silent copilot we didn't realize we invited along. It fixes typos, suggests
                    shows, predicts traffic jams,
                    sorts our photos by who's in them. Things that would've seemed like science fiction ten years ago
                    are now just normal.
                    <strong>Our survey found something interesting - over 70% of people are using some form of AI now,
                        and more than half use it every single day.</strong> That's not a small number. It really shows
                    how embedded this
                    technology has become in our everyday life.
                </p>

                <h3>More than just convenience</h3>
                <p>
                    For most of us, AI is just this helper that saves a bit of time. Faster route home. Song that
                    matches your vibe.
                    Quick translation of a message. Nice, but nothing life-changing.
                    But for some people? It's actually huge. Like hearing aids using AI to cut through background noise,
                    so someone can actually follow what's being said in a noisy restaurant. Or smart home systems that
                    let
                    people with disabilities run their whole environment just by speaking. These aren't fancy extras,
                    they're tools
                    that genuinely change people's daily lives for the better.
                </p>

                <h3>The panic with dependency</h3>
                <p>
                    Here's the thing with tech that works in the background, you forget it's there until something
                    breaks.
                    Everything runs smooth when it's working. But when it stops. That's when it hits you just how much
                    you've been depending on it.
                    We've all been there. Google Maps suddenly freezes while you're driving somewhere new.
                    Translation app gives you total gibberish. That split second of panic. Those moments show you
                    exactly
                    how much trust you've been placing in systems you normally don't even think about.
                </p>
                <h3>Learning from us</h3>
                <p>
                    AI gets better at its job with every click, every search, every tiny piece of data. Slowly, it
                    builds this model of who you are.
                    Not because it actually understands you as a person, but because it's really good at spotting
                    patterns in what you do.
                    It's not learning YOU, exactly. It's learning your habits. The little things that reveal what
                    catches your
                    attention, what you'll probably click next, what time you usually do certain things.

                    Lance Eliot put it pretty bluntly in Forbes: "The AI is identifying a wide array of aspects about
                    what you say,
                    how you carry on the discussions, what interests you, what annoys you, and so on." He went on to
                    warn that
                    "you are actually and actively being profiled during your human-to-AI chats. Your every word and
                    whatever you
                    enter as prompts or otherwise opt to feed into the AI is getting sliced and diced by the AI."
                    <a href="#fn1" id="ref1" class="ref"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    So yeah. AI systems are watching closely. They're interpreting everything we do. Not because
                    they care about understanding us as people, but because they want to get better at predicting what
                    we'll need or want next. <br>

                    This whole relationship we have with algorithms is easy to overlook. It feels natural now. The more
                    we use AI,
                    the more it influences what grabs our attention and what we scroll past. These helpers we can't see
                    just keep learning from us.
                    And we keep trusting them more and more. Most of the time without questioning much.

                <h3>The hidden footprint of AI</h3>
                <p>
                    On the surface, AI feels effortless. A few clicks and boom, you've got your answer. Seems perfect,
                    right?
                    But here's what's actually happening behind your screen: massive computer centres chewing through
                    electricity, water, and resources.
                    Every time you ask AI something or generate an image, thousands of servers fire up simultaneously.
                    And all that computing? It generates serious heat that needs constant cooling. <br>

                    The International Energy Agency (IEA) has some wild projections. They're saying electricity use from
                    data centres, crypto, and AI could nearly double by 2030,
                    hitting around 945 terawatt hours per year<a href="#fn2" id="ref2" class="ref"><sup>[2]</sup></a>.
                    That's almost the same amount of power Japan uses annually. The entire country.
                    In 2024 we were already sitting at 415 TWh per year. That's roughly 1.5% of all the electricity used
                    globally
                    <a href="#fn3" id="ref3" class="ref"><sup>[3]</sup></a>.

                <h3>AI energy consumption</h3>
                <p>
                    AI servers are growing faster than anything else. The IEA is saying power demand from these machines
                    could spike 30% annually
                    while regular data growth is under 10%. You do the math on where that's going.
                    If these projections pan out AI will be consuming half of all data centre power by the end of the
                    decade.

                    Most facilities rely on water cooling. Microsoft saw their water use jump 34% in a single year,
                    using 6.4 million cubic meters by 2022.
                    <a href="#fn4" id="ref4" class="ref"><sup>[4]</sup></a>.
                    Google saw similar spikes, particularly in Oregon and Iowa where their data centres are pulling
                    heavily from local water supplies.
                    <a href="#fn5" id="ref5" class="ref"><sup>[5]</sup></a>.
                    In some American towns, residents have actually been asked to cut back on their own water and power
                    usage so nearby
                    AI data centres could keep running. You can imagine how that went over. People are starting to ask
                    whether these
                    projects are worth the trade-off. Yeah, they bring investment and some jobs, but they're also
                    draining local resources and driving utility bills up.

            <h3>When images fool us</h3>
            <p>
                Then there's the trust issue. Image and video generators have gotten scary good. Even experts are
                struggling to spot fakes now.
                A 2022 PNAS study found something pretty unsettling. People couldn't tell AI faces from real ones
                reliably anymore.
                Even worse? They'd often trust the fake faces MORE than actual people.
                <a href="#fn7" id="ref7" class="ref"><sup>[7]</sup></a>.
                That study's three years old now. The tech's gotten way better since then.
            </p>
            <p>
                We tested this ourselves in our survey. With two images, one from Freepik, one ChatGPT made. Most people
                got it right.
                But 12% didn't. This might not seem like a big percentage, but think about what that means for how
                realistic these fakes have become.
                Can you tell the difference between the two images bellow?
            </p>

            <picture>
                <img src="./assets/img/woman1.jpeg" alt="Real woman">

            <p>
                Creating realistic fake images is cool in theory. But it can also be terrifying, to not distinguish
                what's real.
                Misinformation spreads easier. Identity theft gets simpler. Abuse becomes harder to prevent.
            </p>

            <h3>The harm behind the convenience</h3>
            <p>
                Here's where things get dark. Really dark. Same tools making art and entertainment are being used for
                horrible things.
                The Internet Watch Foundation(IWF) reported a massive spike in AI-generated child sexual abuse material.
                <a href="#fn8" id="ref8" class="ref"><sup>[8]</sup></a>.
                In the first half of 2025 they found 210 webpages containing videos like this. It was a 400% increase
                from 2024.
                Those pages contained 1,286 videos. The Year before it was only two.
                <a href="#fn9" id="ref9" class="ref"><sup>[9]</sup></a>. <br>

                Many of these videos use real kids' faces and bodies. The IWF is warning that full-length AI-generated
                abuse
                videos are becoming possible and calls them "inevitable unless stricter safeguards are put in place".
                <a href="#fn10" id="ref10" class="ref"><sup>[10]</sup></a>.

                The big AI companies like OpenAI and Google have policies blocking this stuff. But smaller platforms
                often they don't care.
                Some even advertise "uncensored" generators where anyone can make fake nudes or explicit content for a
                monthly subscription.
                These tools are stupidly easy to access, nearly impossible to regulate properly, and they're causing
                genuine harm to real people
                whose faces and bodies get used without their consent.
            </p>

            <h3>The trade-off</h3>
            <p>
                So AI's promising all this convenience. Instant answers. Personalized feeds. Realistic images on demand.
                Sounds great, right?
                But there's a price tag most people aren't seeing. The power requirements alone are hitting local
                communities and the environment hard.
                Truth and lies are getting harder to tell apart. And that creative freedom that seemed so exciting
                is turned into a weapon people use to spread lies and cause harm. <br>

                And the technology is still evolving. Looking ahead, there's potential for even darker applications.
                Military use, for instance, opens up a whole new level of risk for global security.
                We could be looking at AI as an actual weapon of mass destruction one day.

                    Sara's laptop pings. "Grammarly has made 12 suggestions to improve your writing." She's only halfway
                    through this quarterly report.
                    It was due yesterday. At this point she'll take whatever help she can get. Few clicks and her
                    sentences are tighter,
                    her tone sounds more professional. She just saved herself a boring proofread session. <br>

                    Down the hall Marcus is trying something different. He types into ChatGPT: "Write me a first draft
                    for the marketing campaign proposal,
                    focus on sustainability and target millennials." Half a minute later he's looking at two pages of
                    ideas.
                    Not perfect and it definitely needs editing. But it's a solid start that would've taken him hours to
                    come up with alone. <br>

                    That's what offices look like now. No robot takeover. No sci-fi stuff. Just these little bits of AI
                    help sliding into the routine.
                    An NRK article from 2025 mentioned over half of Norwegians using AI for writing, research, daily
                    work stuff.
                    Three months before October 2025? 54% of people aged 16-79 were using it. In 2024 that number was

                    Adam Biddlecombe put it quite well: <br>
                    "Staring at a blank page? Ideas refusing to show up? Brain fried from overthinking? ChatGPT can
                    spark it. Prompts can
                    fuel it. Your creativity can explode."

                    His point is that AI can be used to enhance your creativity. Acting as a powerful partner that helps
                    you power through
                    mental blocks or generate fresh ideas.

                <h3>In the classroom</h3>
                <p>
                    At schools, that's where it really gets complicated. Teachers are in this awkward spot. They see AI
                    could totally change learning for the better.
                    But they also worry it'll just replace actual learning.
                    Cherie Shields teaches high school English in Oregon. She's pretty direct about it:
                    "We've already had a number of students turn in AI-generated essays and they're so easy to spot.
                    It's flawless. Not a single grammatical error.
                    All the sentences are perfect. And when you're working with students of that age, you know that they
                    don't write flawlessly like that."
                    <a href="#fn13" id="ref13" class="ref"><sup>[13]</sup></a> <br>

                    The numbers back up what teachers are seeing. A 2024 global survey by the DEC found that 86% of
                    students are using generative AI for schoolwork.
                    More than half use it weekly. Among American high schoolers, about one in four have used ChatGPT
                    for school stuff according to a 2025 Pew Research report. That's double what it was last year

                    These aren't all kids trying to cheat, though. A lot of them describe AI as more of a study buddy,
                    tutor, or brainstorming tool.
                    Some said it helps them work through complex ideas or understand difficult concepts better.

                <h3>The Future Is Already Here</h3>
                <p>
                    AI's changing work and learning whether we're ready or not. In classrooms the hope is it gets
                    students thinking critically
                    instead of just memorizing. At work it takes care of the boring repetitive tasks so people can do
                    more creative things.
                    Is it progress? Depends who you're asking. Either way though, this tech isn't disappearing. It's
                    actively shaping what's coming.

            <article>
                <h3>The phone that knows you personally</h3>
                <p>
                    You might not even notice when it happens. One morning your phone could start doing more than just
                    answering questions,
                    it might quietly reorganize your whole day. Slept badly? It delays your first meeting, dims the
                    lights, cues up a chill playlist.
                    All before you've had coffee.
                </p>

                <h3>Reading between the lines and your emotions</h3>
                <p>
                    This is what experts are calling "ambient AI", technology that just fades into the background.
                    It responds to context instead of waiting for commands. MIT Technology Review wrote about this in
                    2025 -
                    researchers and companies are pushing hard to develop AI that can read surroundings and user
                    behavior to work more naturally
                    <a href="#fn16" id="ref16" class="ref"><sup>[16]</sup></a>. <br>

                    Parts of this future are already happening. Your smartwatch tracks heart rate, sleep quality, stress
                    levels.
                    Earbuds translate conversations on the fly. Your phone picks up patterns in how you move, type,
                    speak.
                    Every little upgrade quietly tightens the connection between us and our devices.
                    A 2023 ScienceDirect study breaks down how these context-aware systems keep learning and adapting to
                    human behavior through sensors and environmental data
                    <a href="#fn17" id="ref17" class="ref"><sup>[17]</sup></a>. <br>


                    BBC News reported that wearable AI can actually detect emotional states, now spotting signs of
                    fatigue or anxiety
                    <a href="#fn18" id="ref18" class="ref"><sup>[18]</sup></a>.
                    We're moving toward tech that doesn't just respond logically, but emotionally too.
                    AI's becoming less obvious and more embedded in daily life.
                </p>

                <h3>Big tech's involvement</h3>
                <p>
                    The major tech companies are all racing in this direction. MIT Technology Review noted that the next
                    phase of
                    AI development is all about context
                    <a href="#fn16" id="ref16" class="ref"><sup>[16]</sup></a>.
                    Systems that work smoothly across all your devices and adapt to your personal behavior in real time.
                    Apple, Google, all the big players are competing to build intelligence that doesn't just respond
                    when asked,
                    but predicts what you'll need before you think of it.
                </p>
                <h3>What it takes to anticipate emotions</h3>
                <p>

                    Sounds convenient. Almost magical, right? Until you stop and think about what's actually required.
                    For AI to predict your needs, it has to know you. Like really, truly know you. Not just "oh you like
                    coffee",

                    the background,
                    the easier it gets to forget it's constantly watching. Learning.
                    This might be the biggest shift of all. When technology stops asking and just knows, the question

                <p>
                    Day starts. Same as always. Alarm. Phone screen lights up. You haven't said anything yet but it's
                    already doing stuff.
                    The weather's up, route's planned, playlist's going that somehow fits your mood.
                    None of this seems strange anymore. Just normal. AI's sitting there in the background, helping
                    without us really noticing or caring much.
                </p>

                <h3>Just an ordinary, everyday helper</h3>
                <p>
                    Through all of this, we've seen how deep this tech has gotten into everyday life. Fixing typos.
                    Directions.
                    Writing drafts. Photo sorting. Predicting what comes next.
                    Our survey showed most people hitting up AI at least once a day. Productivity mostly. Speed.
                    Learning new things.
                    But also decisions, getting insights, brainstorming sessions. Results showed just how normal AI's
                    gotten in what, a few years?
                    And how many different ways people are using it.

                <h3>There will always be a cost.</h3>
                <p>
                    But convenience has a price tag. Behind instant answers and smooth screens are massive amounts of
                    energy keeping servers alive.
                    People moderating content. Systems quietly deciding what we see.
                    At school and work AI can be really powerful but it also creates new problems. Some people use it
                    for creative sparks,
                    inspiration. Others think it's making us lazy. Too hooked on fast answers instead of actually
                    thinking. It shows how we're
                    dealing with learning, time, effort, trying to find that sweet spot between useful tool and complete
                    dependence.
                </p>

                <h3>The Choice Is Ours</h3>
                <p>
                    AI's not just on screens anymore. It's in our living spaces now. Smart devices watching our habits.
                    Voice assistants always listening. Health apps tracking every little thing. That line between what
                    we decide and what the
                    tech suggests gets fuzzier every year. <br>
                    Living with AI isn't about the tech itself at this point. It's about how we're adapting to it.
                    Staying aware of what it
                    does for us and what it learns about us. Understanding that relationship gives us a better chance at
                    making real choices,
                    not just going with whatever the algorithm thinks we should do.
