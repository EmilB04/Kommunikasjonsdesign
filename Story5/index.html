        <section id="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction - “You've Already Met AI”</h2>
            <p>
                Start with a morning routine vignette: from unlocking your phone to Spotify recommendations, showing how
                AI is present before breakfast.
                Tone: relatable and slightly surprising.
            </p>
            <p>
                The alarm rings softly on your nightstand. You silence it with a tap, still half asleep and groogy.
                Your phone imedietly presents you with the weather, suggests a new spotify playlist, and re routes your
                way to work route because there's a road work on your usual rout. You check your email, the important
                once
                have already been filterd as “important” before you even opened your inbox. You haven't said a single
                word yet,
                but artificial intelligence has been busy for hours, working on making your life more convinient. <br>

                AI isn't something futuristic anymore. It's everywhere, familiar, almost ordinary.
                We read about new breakthroughs and developments every week. Most of us already use them without a
                second thought.
                But what we rarely think about is the extent of it, how much of our daily life runs quietly on
                algorithms that
                anticipate what we need before we even ask? They decide what stories reach our screens, help teachers
                grade papers,
                assist doctors in diagnosis, and choose which songs keep us company while we cook. <br>

                Behind all this convenience is something a lot bigger then we migth think, a system that quietly learns
                from us and develops with the rmation. Every choice we make feeds it. The songs we skip, the routes we
                take,
                the things we search for when we can't fall sleep. AI doesn't just follow instructions, it observes and
                reflects.
                Over time, it begins to understand our routines, our preferences, and mabye even our moods. <br>

                This story looks at that relationship, how artificial intelligence has become part of our daily life,
                shaping what we do and how we think, often more than we realize.

        <section id="helpers">
            <h2>Section 1 - The Helpers We Don't See</h2>
            <p>
                AI in small decisions: autocomplete, spellcheck, Google Maps, weather predictions.
                Interviews with users or UX designers about convenience and reliance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of the time, we don't think about how many of our choices are quietly made by algorithms.
                We follow the blue line on the map without questioning it, trust the spellcheck, and appreciate the
                movie suggestions
                that appear when we open Netflix. It all feels natural and easy, like part of modern life.
                Few of us stop to wonder how much of that convenience depends on systems that are constantly running and
                learning
                from our actions and input. <br>

                Artificial intelligence has become the silent co-pilot of everyday life. As mentioned it corrects our
                typos, suggests what to
                watch, predicts traffic patterns, and can even help sort our photos by face or location. What once felt
                unimaginable and
                revolutionary has become routine. In our survey we found
                <!--TODO: Add factual data here -->
                (insert data here, e.g., “more than 70% of participants said they use some form of AI technology daily”)
                (Source or reference to the dataset).
                These numbers show how deeply AI has settled into our daily life. <br>

                For many people, AI has turned into a quiet form of assistance that saves time and removes small
                frustrations.
                It helps us find the fastest way home, choose a song that fits our mood, or translate a message in
                another language.
                For others, it can make a huge difference in accessibility and inclusion.
                Adaptive hearing aids use AI to separate speech from background noise, and smart home systems allow
                people with
                disabilities to get a good overview of their environment through voice assistent. These are small but
                powerful ways
                technology blends to fit human needs. <br>

                What makes this technology so effective is how invisible it feels. When it works, it feels so normal,
                when it fails,
                it reminds us of how dependent we have become on the technology. Most of us have experienced the quiet
                panic when
                Google Maps crashes or when translating a text message turns into something strange. These moments
                expose how much
                trust we place in systems we rarely think about. <br>

                AI systems are designed to learn and improve by learning from us. Every click, every search adds small
                pieces of information.
                Over time, the system builds a model of who we are. Not because it truly understands us, but because it
                recognizes
                patterns in our behavior. What it learns is not us personally, but our tendencies, our small habits that
                shows what
                gets our attention. <br>
                As Lance Eliot wrote in Forbes, “The AI is identifying a wide array of aspects about what you say,
                how you carry on the discussions, what interests you, what annoys you, and so on.” He also warned that
                “you are actually and actively being profiled during your human-to-AI chats. Your every word and
                whatever
                you enter as prompts or otherwise opt to feed into the AI is getting sliced and diced by the AI.”
                <sup>[1]</sup> <br>
                These observations highlight how closely AI systems watch and interpret our behavior,
                not to understand us as individuals, but to better predict our needs. <br>

                This quiet relationship between humans and algorithms is easy to overlook because it feels so natural.
                The more we depend on AI in daily life, the more it quietly shapes what we notice and what just slips
                past us.
                The helpers we don't notice keep learning from us, and in turn we grow used to trusting them, often
                blindly.
