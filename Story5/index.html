                    Start with a morning routine vignette: from unlocking your phone to Spotify recommendations, showing
                    how
                    AI is present before breakfast.
                    Tone: relatable and slightly surprising.

                <img src="assets/img/ai_morning.jpg" alt="Morning routine with AI">
                <p>
                    The alarm rings softly on your nightstand. You silence it with a tap, still half asleep and groogy.
                    Your phone imedietly presents you with the weather, suggests a new spotify playlist, and re routes
                    your
                    way to work route because there's a road work on your usual rout. You check your email, the
                    important
                    once
                    have already been filterd as “important” before you even opened your inbox. You haven't said a
                    single
                    word yet,
                    but artificial intelligence has been busy for hours, working on making your life more convinient.
                    <br>

                    AI isn't something futuristic anymore. It's everywhere, familiar, almost ordinary.
                    We read about new breakthroughs and developments every week. Most of us already use them without a
                    second thought.
                    But what we rarely think about is the extent of it, how much of our daily life runs quietly on
                    algorithms that
                    anticipate what we need before we even ask? They decide what stories reach our screens, help
                    teachers
                    grade papers,
                    assist doctors in diagnosis, and choose which songs keep us company while we cook. <br>

                    Behind all this convenience is something a lot bigger then we migth think, a system that quietly
                    learns
                    from us and develops with the rmation. Every choice we make feeds it. The songs we skip, the routes
                    we
                    take,
                    the things we search for when we can't fall sleep. AI doesn't just follow instructions, it observes
                    and
                    reflects.
                    Over time, it begins to understand our routines, our preferences, and mabye even our moods. <br>

                    This story looks at that relationship, how artificial intelligence has become part of our daily
                    life,
                    shaping what we do and how we think, often more than we realize.

                    AI in small decisions: autocomplete, spellcheck, Google Maps, weather predictions.

                </p>
                <img src="assets/img/ai_tasks.jpg" alt="AI assisting with daily tasks">
                <p>
                    Most of the time, we don't think about how many of our choices are quietly made by algorithms.
                    We follow the blue line on the map without questioning it, trust the spellcheck, and appreciate the
                    movie suggestions
                    that appear when we open Netflix. It all feels natural and easy, like part of modern life.
                    Few of us stop to wonder how much of that convenience depends on systems that are constantly running
                    and
                    learning
                    from our actions and input. <br>

                    Artificial intelligence has become the silent co-pilot of everyday life. As mentioned it corrects
                    our
                    typos, suggests what to
                    watch, predicts traffic patterns, and can even help sort our photos by face or location. What once
                    felt
                    unimaginable and
                    revolutionary has become routine. In our survey we found
                    <!--TODO: Add factual data here -->
                    (insert data here, e.g., “more than 70% of participants said they use some form of AI technology
                    daily”)
                    (Source or reference to the dataset).
                    These numbers show how deeply AI has settled into our daily life. <br>

                    For many people, AI has turned into a quiet form of assistance that saves time and removes small
                    frustrations.
                    It helps us find the fastest way home, choose a song that fits our mood, or translate a message in
                    another language.
                    For others, it can make a huge difference in accessibility and inclusion.
                    Adaptive hearing aids use AI to separate speech from background noise, and smart home systems allow
                    people with
                    disabilities to get a good overview of their environment through voice assistent. These are small
                    but
                    powerful ways
                    technology blends to fit human needs. <br>

                    What makes this technology so effective is how invisible it feels. When it works, it feels so
                    normal,
                    when it fails,
                    it reminds us of how dependent we have become on the technology. Most of us have experienced the
                    quiet
                    panic when
                    Google Maps crashes or when translating a text message turns into something strange. These moments
                    expose how much
                    trust we place in systems we rarely think about. <br>

                    AI systems are designed to learn and improve by learning from us. Every click, every search adds
                    small
                    pieces of information.
                    Over time, the system builds a model of who we are. Not because it truly understands us, but because
                    it
                    recognizes
                    patterns in our behavior. What it learns is not us personally, but our tendencies, our small habits
                    that
                    shows what
                    gets our attention. <br>
                    As Lance Eliot wrote in Forbes, “The AI is identifying a wide array of aspects about what you say,
                    how you carry on the discussions, what interests you, what annoys you, and so on.” He also warned
                    that
                    “you are actually and actively being profiled during your human-to-AI chats. Your every word and
                    whatever
                    you enter as prompts or otherwise opt to feed into the AI is getting sliced and diced by the AI.”
                    <sup>[1]</sup> <br>
                    These observations highlight how closely AI systems watch and interpret our behavior,
                    not to understand us as individuals, but to better predict our needs. <br>

                    This quiet relationship between humans and algorithms is easy to overlook because it feels so
                    natural.
                    The more we depend on AI in daily life, the more it quietly shapes what we notice and what just
                    slips
                    past us.
                    The helpers we don't notice keep learning from us, and in turn we grow used to trusting them, often
                    blindly.

                </p>
                <h3>The hidden footprint of AI</h3>
                <p>
                    Artificial intelligence feels effortless on the surface. Just a few clicks and you have the answer
                    to
                    your question, perfect, right?
                    But behind the screen, it depends on huge computer centers that use a lot of electricity, water, and
                    natural resources.
                    Every time someone asks the AI a question or requests it to generate an image, thousands of servers
                    start working at once.
                    As you can imagine, this produces a lot of heat that needs to be cooled down. <br>

                    According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global electricity use from data centers,
                    cryptocurrency, and AI could nearly double by 2030,
                    reaching around 945 terawatt hours (TWh) per year — about the same amount of power that the entire
                    country of Japan uses in a single year<sup>[2]</sup>.
                    In 2024, data centers already consumed about 415 TWh, which is roughly 1.5% of all electricity used
                    worldwide<sup>[3]</sup>. <br>

                    AI servers are growing particularly fast. The IEA estimates that power demand from AI-related
                    machines
                    could
                    increase by 30% each year, while normal data grows by less than 10%. With these projections, by the
                    end
                    of this decade,
                    AI could make up half of all data center energy use<sup>[4]</sup>. <br>

                    Many of these facilities are cooled using water systems. A Microsoft report showed that the
                    company's
                    global water usage increased by 34% in one year, reaching 1.7 billion gallons (6.4 billion liters)
                    in
                    2022<sup>[5]</sup>.
                    Google reported similar growth, especially in Oregon and Iowa, where local data centers rely heavily
                    on
                    community water sources<sup>[6]</sup>.
                    In some U.S. towns, residents were even asked to reduce their own water and power use so nearby AI
                    data
                    centers could keep operating.
                    Communities are starting to question whether these projects are worth it. They bring some investment
                    and
                    jobs, but they also drain local
                    resources and raise utility prices. A few towns have even paused or limited new data center
                    construction
                    after public protests<sup>[7]</sup>. <br>

                    <!-- TODO: Add data from our own questionnaire -->
                    Maybe add data from our own questionnaire, for example: “Only 20% of our respondents said they had
                    considered how much power AI uses.”
            </article>
            </p>

            <h3>When images fool us</h3>
            <p>
                Another cost of AI is trust. Image and video generators have become so advanced that even experts
                struggle to
                tell what's real and what's fake. A 2022 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
                Sciences (PNAS)
                found that participants could no longer separate AI-generated faces from real ones consistently and
                often rated the fake faces as more trustworthy<sup>[8]</sup>.
                That was three years ago, and since then, AI tools have become far more capable. <br>

                Below are two images, one collected from Freepik.com and one generated with ChatGPT. Can you tell the
                real from the fake?
            </p>

            <img src="./assets/img/woman1.jpeg" alt="Real woman">
            <img src="./assets/img/woman2GPT.png" alt="AI-generated woman">

            <p>
                The ability to generate realistic images is both fascinating and scary.
                When fake visuals become impossible to detect, misinformation spreads fast and identity abuse becomes
                easier.
            </p>

            <h3>The harm behind the convenience</h3>
            <p>
                The same tools that create art and entertainment are also being used in far more harmful ways.
                The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) reported a sharp increase in AI-generated child sexual abuse
                material<sup>[9]</sup>.
                In the first half of 2025, the organization found 210 webpages containing such content — a 400% increase
                compared to 2024.
                Those pages included 1,286 videos, up from only two the year before<sup>[10]</sup>. <br>

                Many of these images and videos use real children's faces or bodies. The IWF warns that full-length
                AI-generated abuse videos are now becoming possible, describing them as “inevitable unless stricter
                safeguards are put in place”<sup>[11]</sup>.
                While major AI companies like OpenAI and Google have strict policies to block harmful content,
                smaller platforms often don't. Some even advertise “uncensored” generators that let users create fake
                nude or
                explicit images for a subscription fee. These tools are easy to access, hard to regulate, and cause real
                harm to
                people whose faces and bodies are used without their consent.
            </p>

            <h3>The trade-off</h3>
            <p>
                AI promises convenience, instant answers, personalized feeds, and realistically generated images. But it
                all comes at a cost most people don't see.
                The power needed to run these massive systems affects local communities as well as the planet.
                It makes truth harder to separate from fiction. And the same creative freedom that inspires us has also
                turned into a weapon for misinformation and abuse. <br>

                The technology is still developing, but in the future, it could be an even bigger threat for military
                use.
                This would raise new risks for global security, as AI could one day be used as a weapon of mass
                destruction and cause countless casualties.

            <article>
                <p>
                    How generative AI (like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or Midjourney) changes productivity.
                    Interviews or quotes from teachers, students, or professionals.
                </p>
                <h3>At the office</h3>
                <p>
                    A notification pops up on Sara's laptop  "Grammarly has made 12 suggestions to improve your writing." 
                    She's halfway through a big quarterly report that was supposed to be in yesterday and at this point she's grateful for any help she can get. 
                    A few clicks later, her sentences are cleaner, her tone is more professional, and she's saved time not having to proofread. <br>

                    Down the hall, her colleague Marcus is utilising AI in a different way. "Write me a first draft for the marketing campaign proposal, 
                    focus on sustainability and target millennials." is what he asks ChatGPT to help him with. 
                    Thirty seconds later, he has two pages of ideas to work with. They are not perfect or finished by any means, 
                    but it is a solid foundation that would have taken him hours to brainstorm himself. <br>

                    This is how a day at the office is now. Not with dramatic robot takeovers or sci-fi scenarios, but with small assistance that slips into our daily routines with convenience. 
                    According to an article from NRK in 2025, more than half of Norwegians are already using AI to help with writing, research or other daily tasks. 
                    In the three months leading up to October 2025, 54% of people between 16 and 79 reported that they use AI. 
                    Compared to 2024, when it was only 36%, we can see a clear and significant increase. 
                    This shows how quickly the technology is becoming part of everyday life, both at work and at school.<sup>[12]</sup>.

                    Adam Biddlecombe, founder of the AI newsletter Mindstream, made a post on LinkedIn saying “Stuck staring at a blank page? Ideas refusing to show up? 
                    Brain fried from overthinking? ChatGPT can spark it. Prompts can fuel it. Your creativity can explode.”<sup>[13]</sup> 
                    His point being that AI can be used to enhance your creativity. Acting as a powerful partner that helps you 
                    power through mental blocks or generate fresh ideas. <br>

                </p>
                <h3>In the classroom</h3>
                <p>
                    But it is in schools where the real worrier comes out. Teachers now a days are caught between embracing a tool that could 
                    revolutionize learning and worrying that it might replace the entire learning process for their students. 
                    Cherie Shields, a high school English teacher in Oregon says “We've already had a number of students turn 
                    AI-generated essays in and they're so easy to spot. It's flawless. Not a single grammatical error. 
                    All the sentences are perfect. And when you're working with students of that age, you know that they don't write flawlessly like that.”<sub>[14]</sub> <br>

                    Numbers tells the story of a fast developing and wildly used tool. A 2024 global survey by the DEC 
                    found that around 86% of students use generative AI in their school work, and more than half rely on it on a weekly bases. 
                    Among U.S. high schoolers, a 2025 Pew Research Center report found that about one in four teens have used ChatGPT for schoolwork. 
                    This is double the amount from last year. These aren't necessarily students looking to cheat, many describe AI as a study partner, tutor, or brainstorming companion<sup>[15]</sup>. <br>

                    As one student explained from the University of Maryland's Generative AI Teaching and Learning Survey<sup>[16]</sup>, 
                    “English is my second language, and I find these tools helpful to deliver what I want to say more efficiently.” 
                    Another noted that AI acts as 
                    “a kind of digital study buddy that helps me summarize difficult readings or check my understanding before class.” <br>
                </p>
                <h3>The Future Is Already Here</h3>
                <p>
                    AI is changing the way we study and perform at work. In classrooms, it encourages students to think more critically 
                    instead of just memorizing information. In the office, it takes repetitive tasks off our plate and gives us more room for creative thinking. 
                    Whether that feels like progress or not really depends on how you look at it. But one thing's certain, this technology is already shaping our future, and it's here to stay.

                <p>
                    Expert commentary on next steps: ambient AI, wearables, voice-driven assistants.
                    End with reflection: “Will AI still feel invisible when it starts knowing you better than you do?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    You might not even notice when it happens. One morning soon, your phone could do more than just answer your 
                    questions. It might quietly rearrange your day. If it senses you slept poorly, it could delay your first meeting, 
                    lower the brightness of your lights, and play a calming playlist before you have even had your coffee. <br>

                    This is the kind of future experts now refer to as ambient AI. It is technology that fades into the background and 
                    responds to context rather than commands. According to MIT Technology Review (2025), researchers and companies are 
                    now focusing on developing AI systems that can interpret surroundings and user behavior to work more intuitively<sup>[17]</sup>. <br>

                    Pieces of that future are already here. Smartwatches monitor heart rate, sleep, and stress. Earbuds can translate 
                    conversations in real time. Phones recognize patterns in how we move, type, and speak. Each small improvement 
                    quietly deepens the connection between people and machines. A study published in ScienceDirect (2023) 
                    explains how context-aware and ambient intelligence systems are learning to adapt to human activity continually through sensors and environmental feedback<sup>[18]</sup>. <br>

                    BBC News has reported that wearable AI can now detect emotional states and even identify signs of fatigue or anxiety<sup>[19]</sup>. 
                    This hints at a future where technology can respond to us not just logically but emotionally. These developments show 
                    how AI is slowly becoming less visible yet more integrated into our daily routines. <br>

                    Meanwhile, major technology companies are moving in the same direction. MIT Technology Review (2025) found that the next 
                    stage of AI development focuses on systems that understand context, work seamlessly across devices, and adapt to personal behavior in real time<sup>[17]</sup>. 
                    Industry leaders (like Apple or Google) are competing to build integrated, context-aware intelligence that does not simply 
                    respond to instructions but anticipates what people need next. <br>

                    It all sounds convenient and almost magical, until you think about what it requires. For AI to truly anticipate our needs, 
                    it has to know us well. Not just our preferences but our routines, our habits, and even our moods. 
                    The more this technology blends into the background, the easier it becomes to forget that it's constantly 
                    observing us and learning. This might be the most profound shift of all, because when technology stops asking and starts knowing, 
                    the question that remains is:

            <h2>Conclusion - “Living With the Machine”</h2>
            <article>
                <p> Circle back to the morning vignette but with awareness: now the reader sees AI everywhere. </p>
                <p>
                    The day starts like any other. The alarm goes off, your phone lights up, and before you even say anything it has 
                    already started doing small things for you. It knows the weather, sets your route to work, and plays the right 
                    playlist to match your morning mood. None of this feels strange anymore. It's just how things are now. 
                    AI has become part of the background of our lives, quietly helping us without us even thinking about it. <br>

                    Through this story, we've seen how deeply it has settled into everything we do. It fixes our spelling, gives us directions, 
                    writes drafts, sorts our photos, and predicts what we might need next. 
                    <!--TODO: Add survey results here-->
                    In our own survey, most people said they use AI at least once a day, usually without really noticing. 
                    Many said it makes life easier, while others admitted they don't 
                    fully understand how it works or what happens to the data it collects. 
                    These results alone shows just how ordinary AI has become in such a short time. <br>

                    But this convenience comes with a cost. Behind the fast answers and smooth tools, there is the energy that keeps servers running, 
                    the people who moderate content, and the systems that quietly shape what we see online. At school and at work, 
                    AI can be a powerful helper, but it also raises new challenges. Some people use it to boost creativity or get inspiration, 
                    while others worry it makes us think less or rely too much on quick results. It reflects how we approach learning, 
                    time, and effort. Balancing between help and full blown dependence. <br>

                    Now AI is moving beyond our screens into the spaces where we live. Smart devices learn our habits, voice assistants 
                    listen for our requests, and health apps track our well-being. The line between human choices and digital guidance is 
                    becoming thinner every year. AI doesn't feel futuristic anymore because it's already here, it's settled into our routines, 
                    shaping our decisions. <br>

                    Living with AI isn't just about technology anymore. It's about how we adapt to it, how we stay aware of what it does 
                    for us, and what it learns from us in return. The more we understand that relationship, the better chance we have to 
                    make our own choices instead of just going along with whatever the technology decides for us.
