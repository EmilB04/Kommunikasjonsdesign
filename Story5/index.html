            <h2>Introduction - “You’ve Already Met AI”</h2>
            <p>
                Start with a morning routine vignette: from unlocking your phone to Spotify recommendations, showing how AI is present before breakfast.
                Tone: relatable and slightly surprising.
            </p>
            <p>
                The alarm rings softly on your nightstand. You silence it with a tap, still half asleep and groogy. 
                Your phone imedietly presents you with the weather, suggests a new spotify playlist, and re routes your 
                way to work route because there’s a road work on your usual rout. You check your email, the important once 
                have already been filterd as “important” before you even opened your inbox. You haven’t said a single word yet, 
                but artificial intelligence has been busy for hours, working on making your life more convinient. <br>

                AI isn’t something futuristic anymore. It’s everywhere, familiar, almost ordinary. 
                We read about new breakthroughs and developments every week. Most of us already use them without a second thought. 
                But what we rarely think about is the extent of it, how much of our daily life runs quietly on algorithms that 
                anticipate what we need before we even ask? They decide what stories reach our screens, help teachers grade papers, 
                assist doctors in diagnosis, and choose which songs keep us company while we cook. <br>

                Behind all this convenience is something a lot bigger then we migth think, a system that quietly learns 
                from us and develops with the information. Every choice we make feeds it. The songs we skip, the routes we take, 
                the things we search for when we can’t fall sleep. AI doesn’t just follow instructions, it observes and reflects. 
                Over time, it begins to understand our routines, our preferences, and mabye even our moods. <br>

                This story looks at that relationship, how artificial intelligence has become part of our daily life, 
                shaping what we do and how we think, often more than we realize.
