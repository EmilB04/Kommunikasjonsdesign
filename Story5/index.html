            <h2>Introduction - “You've Already Met AI”</h2>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Start with a morning routine vignette: from unlocking your phone to Spotify recommendations, showing
                    how
                    AI is present before breakfast.
                    Tone: relatable and slightly surprising.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The alarm rings softly on your nightstand. You silence it with a tap, still half asleep and groogy.
                    Your phone imedietly presents you with the weather, suggests a new spotify playlist, and re routes
                    your
                    way to work route because there's a road work on your usual rout. You check your email, the
                    important
                    once
                    have already been filterd as “important” before you even opened your inbox. You haven't said a
                    single
                    word yet,
                    but artificial intelligence has been busy for hours, working on making your life more convinient.
                    <br>

                    AI isn't something futuristic anymore. It's everywhere, familiar, almost ordinary.
                    We read about new breakthroughs and developments every week. Most of us already use them without a
                    second thought.
                    But what we rarely think about is the extent of it, how much of our daily life runs quietly on
                    algorithms that
                    anticipate what we need before we even ask? They decide what stories reach our screens, help
                    teachers
                    grade papers,
                    assist doctors in diagnosis, and choose which songs keep us company while we cook. <br>

                    Behind all this convenience is something a lot bigger then we migth think, a system that quietly
                    learns
                    from us and develops with the rmation. Every choice we make feeds it. The songs we skip, the routes
                    we
                    take,
                    the things we search for when we can't fall sleep. AI doesn't just follow instructions, it observes
                    and
                    reflects.
                    Over time, it begins to understand our routines, our preferences, and mabye even our moods. <br>

                    This story looks at that relationship, how artificial intelligence has become part of our daily
                    life,
                    shaping what we do and how we think, often more than we realize.

            <h2>Section 1 - The Helpers We Don't See</h2>
            <article>
                <p>
                    AI in small decisions: autocomplete, spellcheck, Google Maps, weather predictions.
                    Interviews with users or UX designers about convenience and reliance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most of the time, we don't think about how many of our choices are quietly made by algorithms.
                    We follow the blue line on the map without questioning it, trust the spellcheck, and appreciate the
                    movie suggestions
                    that appear when we open Netflix. It all feels natural and easy, like part of modern life.
                    Few of us stop to wonder how much of that convenience depends on systems that are constantly running
                    and
                    learning
                    from our actions and input. <br>

                    Artificial intelligence has become the silent co-pilot of everyday life. As mentioned it corrects
                    our
                    typos, suggests what to
                    watch, predicts traffic patterns, and can even help sort our photos by face or location. What once
                    felt
                    unimaginable and
                    revolutionary has become routine. In our survey we found
                    <!--TODO: Add factual data here -->
                    (insert data here, e.g., “more than 70% of participants said they use some form of AI technology
                    daily”)
                    (Source or reference to the dataset).
                    These numbers show how deeply AI has settled into our daily life. <br>

                    For many people, AI has turned into a quiet form of assistance that saves time and removes small
                    frustrations.
                    It helps us find the fastest way home, choose a song that fits our mood, or translate a message in
                    another language.
                    For others, it can make a huge difference in accessibility and inclusion.
                    Adaptive hearing aids use AI to separate speech from background noise, and smart home systems allow
                    people with
                    disabilities to get a good overview of their environment through voice assistent. These are small
                    but
                    powerful ways
                    technology blends to fit human needs. <br>

                    What makes this technology so effective is how invisible it feels. When it works, it feels so
                    normal,
                    when it fails,
                    it reminds us of how dependent we have become on the technology. Most of us have experienced the
                    quiet
                    panic when
                    Google Maps crashes or when translating a text message turns into something strange. These moments
                    expose how much
                    trust we place in systems we rarely think about. <br>

                    AI systems are designed to learn and improve by learning from us. Every click, every search adds
                    small
                    pieces of information.
                    Over time, the system builds a model of who we are. Not because it truly understands us, but because
                    it
                    recognizes
                    patterns in our behavior. What it learns is not us personally, but our tendencies, our small habits
                    that
                    shows what
                    gets our attention. <br>
                    As Lance Eliot wrote in Forbes, “The AI is identifying a wide array of aspects about what you say,
                    how you carry on the discussions, what interests you, what annoys you, and so on.” He also warned
                    that
                    “you are actually and actively being profiled during your human-to-AI chats. Your every word and
                    whatever
                    you enter as prompts or otherwise opt to feed into the AI is getting sliced and diced by the AI.”
                    <sup>[1]</sup> <br>
                    These observations highlight how closely AI systems watch and interpret our behavior,
                    not to understand us as individuals, but to better predict our needs. <br>

                    This quiet relationship between humans and algorithms is easy to overlook because it feels so
                    natural.
                    The more we depend on AI in daily life, the more it quietly shapes what we notice and what just
                    slips
                    past us.
                    The helpers we don't notice keep learning from us, and in turn we grow used to trusting them, often
                    blindly.

                <h3>The hidden footprint of AI</h3>
                <p>
                    Artificial intelligence feels effortless on the surface. Just a few clicks and you have the answer
                    to
                    your question, perfect, right?
                    But behind the screen, it depends on huge computer centers that use a lot of electricity, water, and
                    natural resources.
                    Every time someone asks the AI a question or requests it to generate an image, thousands of servers
                    start working at once.
                    As you can imagine, this produces a lot of heat that needs to be cooled down. <br>

                    According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global electricity use from data centers,
                    cryptocurrency, and AI could nearly double by 2030,
                    reaching around 945 terawatt hours (TWh) per year — about the same amount of power that the entire
                    country of Japan uses in a single year<sup>[2]</sup>.
                    In 2024, data centers already consumed about 415 TWh, which is roughly 1.5% of all electricity used
                    worldwide<sup>[3]</sup>. <br>

                    AI servers are growing particularly fast. The IEA estimates that power demand from AI-related
                    machines
                    could
                    increase by 30% each year, while normal data grows by less than 10%. With these projections, by the
                    end
                    of this decade,
                    AI could make up half of all data center energy use<sup>[4]</sup>. <br>

                    Many of these facilities are cooled using water systems. A Microsoft report showed that the
                    company's
                    global water usage increased by 34% in one year, reaching 1.7 billion gallons (6.4 billion liters)
                    in
                    2022<sup>[5]</sup>.
                    Google reported similar growth, especially in Oregon and Iowa, where local data centers rely heavily
                    on
                    community water sources<sup>[6]</sup>.
                    In some U.S. towns, residents were even asked to reduce their own water and power use so nearby AI
                    data
                    centers could keep operating.
                    Communities are starting to question whether these projects are worth it. They bring some investment
                    and
                    jobs, but they also drain local
                    resources and raise utility prices. A few towns have even paused or limited new data center
                    construction
                    after public protests<sup>[7]</sup>. <br>

                    <!-- TODO: Add data from our own questionnaire -->
                    Maybe add data from our own questionnaire, for example: “Only 20% of our respondents said they had
                    considered how much power AI uses.”
            </article>
            </p>

            <h3>When images fool us</h3>
            <p>
                Another cost of AI is trust. Image and video generators have become so advanced that even experts
                struggle to
                tell what's real and what's fake. A 2022 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
                Sciences (PNAS)
                found that participants could no longer separate AI-generated faces from real ones consistently and
                often rated the fake faces as more trustworthy<sup>[8]</sup>.
                That was three years ago, and since then, AI tools have become far more capable. <br>

                Below are two images, one collected from Freepik.com and one generated with ChatGPT. Can you tell the
                real from the fake?
            </p>

            <img src="./assets/img/woman1.jpeg" alt="Real woman">
            <img src="./assets/img/woman2GPT.png" alt="AI-generated woman">

            <p>
                The ability to generate realistic images is both fascinating and scary.
                When fake visuals become impossible to detect, misinformation spreads fast and identity abuse becomes
                easier.
            </p>

            <h3>The harm behind the convenience</h3>
            <p>
                The same tools that create art and entertainment are also being used in far more harmful ways.
                The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) reported a sharp increase in AI-generated child sexual abuse
                material<sup>[9]</sup>.
                In the first half of 2025, the organization found 210 webpages containing such content — a 400% increase
                compared to 2024.
                Those pages included 1,286 videos, up from only two the year before<sup>[10]</sup>. <br>

                Many of these images and videos use real children's faces or bodies. The IWF warns that full-length
                AI-generated abuse videos are now becoming possible, describing them as “inevitable unless stricter
                safeguards are put in place”<sup>[11]</sup>.
                While major AI companies like OpenAI and Google have strict policies to block harmful content,
                smaller platforms often don't. Some even advertise “uncensored” generators that let users create fake
                nude or
                explicit images for a subscription fee. These tools are easy to access, hard to regulate, and cause real
                harm to
                people whose faces and bodies are used without their consent.
            </p>

            <h3>The trade-off</h3>
            <p>
                AI promises convenience, instant answers, personalized feeds, and realistically generated images. But it
                all comes at a cost most people don't see.
                The power needed to run these massive systems affects local communities as well as the planet.
                It makes truth harder to separate from fiction. And the same creative freedom that inspires us has also
                turned into a weapon for misinformation and abuse. <br>

                The technology is still developing, but in the future, it could be an even bigger threat for military
                use.
                This would raise new risks for global security, as AI could one day be used as a weapon of mass
                destruction and cause countless casualties.
